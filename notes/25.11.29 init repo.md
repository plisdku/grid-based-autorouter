# Starting things

I learned the uv and maturin maneuver the other day:

```
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv init
uv add --dev ruff maturin pre-commit tbump
maturin init foo
```

Copied the contents of `foo/` back into the main directory and adjusted some configuration. Made a hello-world of sorts and it's working.

Note: in pyproject.toml, the build backend is given as "maturin", and I think this enables e.g. `uv sync` to build the project for me. However, `uv sync` seems to build it in an isolate environment, not in my main environment, so I still need to manually run `maturin develop`.
