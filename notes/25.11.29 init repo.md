# Starting things

I learned the uv and maturin maneuver the other day:

```
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv init
uv add --dev ruff maturin pre-commit tbump
maturin init foo
```

Copied the contents of `foo/` back into the main directory and adjusted some configuration. Made a hello-world of sorts and it's working.
